Hi, I'm Marcus!

I'm a Professor of Computer Science at LMU Munich where I lead the Databases Systems group.

<p align="justify">
I'm broadly interested in large-scale data management with a focus on building systems to enable efficient data analysis and processing on large volumes
of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. I am particularly interested in query processing, query optimization and rewriting, index
structures, algorithms, and data structures.</p>

**Are you a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis projects? Contact [me](mailto:marcus.paradies@tu-ilmenau.de) for a list of available topics on large-scale data management within our group.**
